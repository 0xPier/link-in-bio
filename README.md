## Customization Guide

### Changing Profile Information

Edit the `src/app/page.tsx` file:

1. Replace the profile image by changing the `src` attribute in the `Image` component
2. Update your name and bio in the corresponding text elements

### Customizing Links

The links are defined in the `links` array in `src/app/page.tsx`. Each link has:

- `id`: A unique identifier
- `title`: The text to display
- `url`: The URL to navigate to when clicked
- `icon`: The icon to display (using react-icons)

To add or modify links, edit the `links` array.

### Animations

This project uses Framer Motion for smooth, modern animations. You can customize the animations by modifying:

- `containerVariants` and `itemVariants` for the staggered link animations
- Individual motion components' props like `whileHover` and `whileTap`
- Transition parameters for timing and easing
